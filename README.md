# Type Conversion

In C++, type conversion refers to <ins>the process of converting a value from one data type to another</ins>. 

There are several types of type conversions in C++:

### 1. Implicit Conversion (Automatic Type Conversion):

```cpp

int intValue = 5;
float floatValue = intValue; // Implicit conversion from int to float
```

### 2. Explicit Conversion (Type Casting):

2.1 - C-Style Casting:

```cpp

double doubleValue = 3.14;
int intValue = (int)doubleValue; // C-style casting
```

2.2 - Functional Casting:

```cpp

double doubleValue = 3.14;
int intValue = int(doubleValue); // Functional casting
```

### 3. Static Cast:
The static_cast operator takes an expression as input, and returns the evaluated value converted to the type specified inside the angled brackets. 

static_cast is best used to convert one fundamental type into another.

```cpp

double doubleValue = 3.14;
int intValue = static_cast<int>(doubleValue); // Static cast
```

The main advantage of static_cast is that it provides compile-time type checking, making it harder to make an inadvertent error.

static_cast is also (intentionally) less powerful than C-style casts, so you canâ€™t inadvertently remove const or do other things you may not have intended to do.

### 4. Dynamic Cast:

Although dynamic casts have a few different capabilities, by far the most common use for dynamic casting is for converting base-class pointers into derived-class pointers. 

This process is called downcasting

```cpp

class Base {
  // ...
};

class Derived : public Base {
  // ...
};

Base* basePtr = new Derived();
Derived* derivedPtr = dynamic_cast<Derived*>(basePtr); // Dynamic cast
```

# Differences and profile of each cast

### Static Cast:

  - Used for conversions between related types.
  - Resolved at compile-time.
  - Generally performs simple conversions, such as widening or narrowing of numeric types.
  - Safer than C-style casting but doesn't provide runtime type checking.

```cpp

double doubleValue = 3.14;
int intValue = static_cast<int>(doubleValue); // Static cast
```

### Dynamic Cast:

  - Primarily used in polymorphic class hierarchies (classes with at least one virtual function).
  - Performs a runtime check to ensure the conversion is valid.
  - Returns a null pointer if the conversion is not possible (when dealing with pointers), or throws a std::bad_cast exception (when dealing with references).
  - Provides a safer way to downcast within inheritance hierarchies.

```cpp

class Base {
  // ...
};

class Derived : public Base {
  // ...
};

Base* basePtr = new Derived();
Derived* derivedPtr = dynamic_cast<Derived*>(basePtr); // Dynamic cast
```

### Const Cast:

 - Used to add or remove the const qualifier from a variable.
 - Allows modifying a variable that was originally declared as const.
 - Should be used with caution to avoid undefined behavior.

```cpp

const int constValue = 42;
int nonConstValue = const_cast<int>(constValue); // Remove const qualifier
```

### Reinterpret Cast:

 - Converts a pointer type to another pointer type, even if they are not related.
 - Often used for low-level casting, such as casting between pointers and integers.
 - Considered unsafe and should be used with caution.

```cpp

    int intValue = 42;
    double* doublePtr = reinterpret_cast<double*>(&intValue); // Reinterpret cast
```

In summary, each type of cast serves a specific purpose:

 - Static cast is a general-purpose cast for related types, performed at compile-time.
 - Dynamic cast is used for safe downcasting in polymorphic class hierarchies, with runtime type checking.
 - Const cast is used to add or remove the const qualifier.
 - Reinterpret cast is a low-level cast that is less safe and should be used carefully.
